Assignment::Create a Simple two-fold Dashboard using any of the preferred frameworks of your choice. The task is to create a simple two-page dashboard using any standard frameworks for which data is already provided.

Disclaimer: The assignment is not completed and I did not have much help from anyone. Hence, there are only a few steps to run it. Everything I learned for this assignment was from the internet and tried my best to understand how REST API works. I have also added a screenshot from my system to help understand how it looks, in case you felt something is odd or missing from the dashboard.

How to run the program?

Step_1:Make sure your internet is connected at all times since some of the links present in the .html file are from google fonts. Step_2:Open the dash_boardUI.html file.

Even though it's been too late and being only a few minutes away from the deadline I would still like to give an idea of how this assignment could be executed.

How to execute this assignment?

Step_1: Create Dashboard UI using Html, CSS and javascript.

Step_2: Convert .xlsx files to .csv file so that it could be imported to PostgreSQL database.

Step_3: Create a client and server that is connected to the PostgreSQL database using Nodejs or .js file.As I tried to do it in the db_connection.js file.

Step_4: Create APIs to perform Read-only queries to get voltage, current etc among CRUD operations on the Database.

Step_5: Since the data is in JSON format, use another .js file, and use Chart.js to perform linear graphs.

These were the steps I was planning on doing it but couldn't as I needed more time to do it.

THANKS FOR MAKING IT TILL THE END!!!:)
